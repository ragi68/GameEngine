# GameEngine
Making a game engine... idk how this'll go. 

Changes to make if used:

use 'git submodule' feature to copy the glfw library from MY Repo since it contains a premake file needed to run the code properly. Of course, make this go into the global-libs folder to make the direcory right. 


Libraries used: Premake, SPDLogging, and GLFW. 

Currently privately working on alternative to SPD logging, but mostly going to work once base window and features are up and running.
